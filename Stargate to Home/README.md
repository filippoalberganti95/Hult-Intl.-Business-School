# Stargate to home

In this assignment, I've designed a text-based adventure game utilizing the Python essentials learned during my course. 

The working version of the game include:
- An executable script of the game that can be successfully completed within a maximum of 4 minutes
- 3 stages (+1 second chance stage)
- while loop
- Strings and String Manipulation
- User-Defined Functions and Objects (variables)
- User Input and Input Handling
- Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
- Loops (while)
- 1 fail() function (executed whenever a user loses the game)
- An intro at the beginning of game that is no more than 150 words, introduces the game and its purpose and identifies any bugs that are not yet worked out
